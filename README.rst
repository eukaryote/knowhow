`knowhow` is a searchable and scriptable knowledge repository for useful
snippets of information that are worth saving for future reference. It consists
of a library for programmatic use, and a commandline script for interactive
usage.

Overview
--------

The initial motivation for `knowhow` is to have a way of accessing frequently
needed reference information from a shell, text editor, or IDE without having
to search the web and try to find again that one resource that gave the
best information that you can almost but not quite remember.

The script and library  will certainly change in major ways that are backwards-
incompatible, and is not yet ready for general use.


Supported Python Versions and Operating Systems
-----------------------------------------------

`knowhow` should work on any operating system and any Python version that
is 2.7 or greater.
