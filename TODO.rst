To Do
-----

 - change 'tags' subcommand to 'tag', with '-l' for list and other options such as renaming
 - add an edit command to edit a document in an editor and update after in index
 - vendor deps to avoid conflicts while still ensuring specific versions that have been tested (?), and perhaps change fix to use pickle2
 - optionally include id in results (default or not?)
 - load should read line by line, assuming standard dump format, to handle large files
 - filehandles for reading should handle binary or text mode
